\begin{enumerate}
\item A trust invested money in two types of bonds. The first bond pays $10\%$ interest and the second bond pays $12\%$ interest. The trust received \rupee$2,800$ as interest. However, if the trust had interchanged money in the bonds, it would have got \rupee$100$ less as interest. Using matrix method, find the amount invested by the trust. Interest received on this amount will be given to HELPAGE INDIA as donation. Which value is reflected in this question? 
\item There are two types of fertilisers $A$ and $B$. $A$ consists of $12\%$ nitrogen and $5\%$ phosphoric acid whereas $B$ consists of $4\%$ nitrogen and $5\%$ phosphoric acid. After testing the soil conditions, farmer finds that he needs at least $12$ kg of nitrogen and $12$ kg of phosphoric acid for his crops. If $A$ costs $10$ per kg and $B$ costs $8$ per kg, then graphically determine how much of each type of fertiliser should be used so that nutrient requirements are met at a minimum cost.
\item Show that the binary operation on $A=R-\{-1\}$ defined as $a*b=a+b+ab$ for all $a, b \in A$ is commutative and associative on $A$. Also find the identity element of $*$ in $A$ and prove that every element of $A$ is invertible.
